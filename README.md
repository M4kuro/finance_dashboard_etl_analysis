# Finance Data Pipeline & Dashboard

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end finance data workflow.
Raw financial data is cleaned and transformed using Python, then visualized in Power BI.

## Problem Statement
Financial data often comes in raw, inconsistent formats that require cleaning
before meaningful analysis can be performed.

2. Data cleaning and standardization with Python
    - Standardized column names
    - Handled missing growth rate values
    - Calculated profit from revenue and profit margin
    - Selected finance-relevant fields

3. Export of processed datasets
4. Visualization in Power BI

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas)
- Power BI
- Git / GitHub
